## Additional Notes

### Standardisation

Where possible the *Statistical Bulletin* reporting standards for catch and effort statistics support the international standards set by the FAO Coordinating Working Party on Fisheries Statistics (CWP) [CWP Handbook of Fishery Statistics](http://www.fao.org/cwp-on-fishery-statistics/handbook/en/):

* Country Codes and names are aligned with ISO 3166-1 (see [FAO CWP Country or areas](http://www.fao.org/cwp-on-fishery-statistics/handbook/general-concepts/country-or-areas/en/)).
* Fishing Gear Types are aligned with the International Standard Statistical Classification of Fishing Gear (see [FAO CWP Fishing Gear Classification](http://www.fao.org/cwp-on-fishery-statistics/handbook/capture-fisheries-statistics/fishing-gear-classification/en/)).
* Vessel Size Categories are aligned with the International Standard Statistical Classification of Fishery Vessels by GRT (see [FAO CWP Fishery fleet](http://www.fao.org/cwp-on-fishery-statistics/handbook/capture-fisheries-statistics/fishery-fleet/en/)).
* Geographic Areas are aligned with the FAO Major Fishing Areas (see [FAO CWP Handbook – Fishing Areas for Statistical Purposes](http://www.fao.org/cwp-on-fishery-statistics/handbook/general-concepts/fishing-areas-for-statistical-purposes/en/)).

### CAMLR Convention Area

CAMLR’s Convention Area extends from the coast of Antarctica to the Antarctic Convergence, at latitudes ranging from 45–60° South. The Convention Area is circumpolar and encompasses the southern sectors of the Atlantic Ocean (Statistical Area 48), Indian Ocean (Statistical Area 58) and Pacific Ocean (Statistical Area 88). Each statistical area is divided into subareas (e.g. Subareas 881, 882 and 883) and then further divided into divisions (e.g. Divisions 5851 and 5852). For further information on the CAMLR Convention Area and geographical areas refer to

* [CAMLR Convention Area](https://www.ccamlr.org/en/organisation/convention-area)
* [CCAMLR Online GIS](https://gis.ccamlr.org/).

### Year, month and CCAMLR fishing season allocations

The CCAMLR fishing season was defined in 2001 as 1 December to 30 November (refer [Conservation Measure (CM) 32-01](https://www.ccamlr.org/measure-32-01)). The CCAMLR fishing season is identified by the year at the end of the season. For example, CCAMLR fishing season 2020 is from 1 December 2019 to 30 November 2020. The CCAMLR fishing season has been allocated to historical data based on reported year and month. Note that some of the historical aggregated data was provided only on a calendar year or split year (July to June) basis and without providing a month, hence precluding the assignment of CCAMLR fishing season to these records. The CCAMLR fishing season field for these records remains blank.

For current records, the year, month and CCAMLR fishing season are allocated from the date the fishing activity ended as reported in the haul-by-haul data record. The fishing activity reported in each haul-by-haul data record includes the set start/end dates and haul start/end dates. When the haul date is not recorded due to gear loss, the set date is used as the date the fishing activity ends. All date- and time-related calculations are performed using UTC time.

### Taxonomy code allocations

The CCAMLR taxonomy used to describe species is based on

* FOA CWP Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Information System (ASFIS) species list, see [http://www.fao.org/cwp-on-fishery-statistics/handbook/](http://www.fao.org/cwp-on-fishery-statistics/handbook/general-concepts/identifiers-for-aquatic-animals-and-plants/en/)
* World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS), see [https://www.marinespecies.org/](https://www.marinespecies.org/)

From Volume 34 onwards the historical taxonomy codes are updated to the currently used codes as requested in SC-CAMLR-38 paragraph 14.1(iv)(a). The code changes are listed below for reference.

| historical code | historical name | current code | current name |

### Fishing effort notes

The following notes provide some details on the current calculation methods which should be considered when using fishing effort data.

* Catch records and their associated effort are allocated to a year and month period from the date the fishing activity ended as reported in the haul-by-haul data record. Therefore when the fishing activity is recorded over multiple monthly periods a portion of the effort may not be allocated to the same month that the effort was expended.
* Fishing Days is a count of the unique dates when each fishing activity ends and does not account for dates when a vessel performs setting or fishing activity without completing a haul-by-haul data record for those dates.
* Vessels using continuous trawling report multiple haul-by-haul data records at regular time intervals throughout the day.
* Some vessels use multiple nets at the same time. Trawl duration is the summed trawling duration for each net and not the trawling duration for the vessel.
* Apart from Fishing days and haul count, some fishing effort measures only apply when specific fishing gear is used:
  * Trawl duration hours applies to trawl gear types only
  * Hook count applies to longline gear types only.
  * Pot count applies to pot gear types only.

### Data Collection and history of the Bulletin

The production of a yearly *Statistical Bulletin* was considered and approved by SC-CAMLR-V (paragraph 7.9). The initial volumes 1 and 2 of the *Statistical Bulletin* were first published in 1990 and covered data from 1970 to 1989. The first publications of the *Statistical Bulletin* were only available as printed copies and because of this they included a large number of tabulations of the data. The selected tables that have been retained and are included in this release (4.1, 6, 7.1, 8.1, 9.1, 11.1) are those that were reportedly of most interest to users.

The *Statistical Bulletin* uses STATLANT data as its primary source, however, it should be noted that the methods used to derive and collect this data have changed over the years. STATLANT forms were originated as standard questionnaires designed by the Coordinating Working Party on Fisheries Statistics ([http://www.fao.org/fishery/cwp/en](http://www.fao.org/fishery/cwp/en)) for use in FAO’s acquisition of global fishery statistics. The STATLANT A data provided annual catch data by species and statistical sub-divisions of the relevant FAO major fishing areas. The STATLANT B data (form 08B) provided monthly catch and effort data by species, statistical sub-divisions of the relevantFAO major fishing areas, fishing gear, size class of fishing vessel and target species. In 1983 the Commission endorsed the use of STATLANT forms (CCAMLR-II, paragraph 44; SC-CAMLR-II, paragraph 25) for data reporting from the 1984 split year onwards and the requested data was reported to the CCAMLR Secretariat by national statistics offices. The Secretariat also worked with Members to compile STATLANT-equivalent data for the previous years where possible.

From 1986 Members started reporting detailed fine-scale data for some fisheries, some of which was presented in the *Statistical Bulletin*. Fine-scale data is data aggregated over areas of size 1 degree longitude by 0.5 degree latitude. Over time this scale of reporting was replaced by detailed catch and effort and haul by haul data (C Data submitted in accordance with CM 23-04). To address alignment between the detailed data and reported STATLANT data the Commission endorsed a new process in 2007 in which the Secretariat derived the preliminary STATLANT data from detailed catch and effort data reported to the Secretariat during the course of the year (CCAMLR-XXVI, paragraph 4.89). This preliminary STATLANT data was subsequently reviewed, and in some cases amended, by the national statistics offices of CCAMLR Members. Since 2021 the detailed haul by haul data have been considered as the primary data source, and STATLANT has been only a derived dataset (SC-CAMLR-38, paragraph 3.8).

When using the *Statistical Bulletin* data users should bear in mind this historical context of the history of data collection in CCAMLR.

### Krill Catches by small-scale management units (SSMUs)

Previous *Statistical Bulletins* have included the krill catches by small-scale management units (SSMUs) in Area 48. This data was no longer included in the *Statistical Bulletin* as of Volume 32. This data can now be found in the [CCAMLR Fishery Reports](http://fisheryreports.ccamlr.org/).

## Combined data table

The combined data table has been introduced in Volume 33 to provide all the catch, effort and reference data in a single file for ease of use. The file is structured with a single effort record followed by multiple associated catch records. Descriptions and other relevant data has also been included for reference. Data is aggregated by year, month, vessel nationality, fishing purpose, gear type, target species, geographical area, vessel size category and catch species.
